by using law of total probability
and law of conditional probability, we know how to compute posterior distribution
You need the posterior distribution,  p(¦È|y) , and a loss function  C(¦È,a)  to make an optimal decision according to Bayesian decision theory. Having a prior and a likelihood is equivalent to having the posterior, since we know how to calculate the posterior from these two.


theta map, theta mmse, used for estimating theta(real value) when we have posterior p(theta|y)

2.filtering
motion model:p(xk|xk-1) physical model
measurement model: how the measurements relate to the state vector p(yk|xk)
prior

why baysian rule?because actually the real value leads to the oberserved value,
but we are estimating the real value by observed data
