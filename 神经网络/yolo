1. how does yolo handle the difficulty that the number of output of object detection is unknow beforehand.
Every cell has 2 anchor boxes. So YOLO detects maximally 2 objects in one cell. If 3 objects are in one cell. YOLO cannot handle it too.
2. how does yolo output look like
one or two bounding boxs per cell. One object may be detected as two achor boxes because of ambiguous shape(like square), but using nms one of them maybe deleted.
