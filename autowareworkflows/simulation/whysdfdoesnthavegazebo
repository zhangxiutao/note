The <gazebo> Element

The <gazebo> element is an extension to the URDF used for specifying additional properties needed for simulation purposes in Gazebo. It allows you to specify the properties found in the SDF format that are not included in the URDF format. None of the elements within a <gazebo> element are required because default values will be automatically included. There are three different types of <gazebo> elements - one for the <robot> tag, one for <link> tags, and one for <joint> tags. We will discuss the attributes and elements within each type of <gazebo> element throughout this tutorial.
