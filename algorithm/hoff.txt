1. hogh transformation is just a algorithm which can get local model from
data which contains large amount of noise.
2.hogh is essentially a brute force search of  grid computing by knowing solution space
3.the first step is to paramaterize the model, then choose key

4.sliding window+cnn, ransac, hough are all searching algorithms which needs keys
to determin whether it is something we want or not

5. functions are also data point when they can be paramaterized

6. pca also projects the data points into another space just like hough
