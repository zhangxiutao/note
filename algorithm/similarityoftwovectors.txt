1.jaccard similarity
2.cosine similarity,calculate the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
3.centered cosine,normalize the data around 0 by substractig the mean value at
first. then do cosine similarity

4.why users and movies problems can be described as a correlation filtering?
Because for a user we have a sequence of data(movies), just like sensor data with respect to time.
And we find a user which is similar to this user, and use the taste of that user to predict the missing data point of this user

5. So correlation filtering is about how to encode the similatiry and how to use the similar user to predict the missing rating of movie of a certain user
