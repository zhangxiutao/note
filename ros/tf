why i cannot remember what tf does for me?
Because i don't know what tf has done for me.
i don't know what does transform.setOrigin( tf::Vector3(msg->x, msg->y, 0.0) ); do or br.sendTransform(tf::StampedTransform(transform, ros::Time::now(), "world", turtle_name)); do.
Why do i need tf::Transform data structure.
for me the best way is to remember that, structuring raw data and communicating stuff are done by tf. And the most important api
is lookuptransform which does all the matrix multiplication for you.
two things when using tf:
1.get sensor data and publish it as tf::transform
2.get transform between any two coordinate systems by lookuptransform

what is framework, we put things into it, and it will run with its rule, and we get the result.
I am communicating with framework through interface.
what is interface, it is the line of code which should be referenced by author and user.


Sometimes I don't know what should I do to achieve such a result like turtlesim. Because I don't know what is happening
below the interfaces which I have been using. I can only say that I should use qt to display, I should create a node which
does visualization and a node which does the computation about the pose of turtle(start point, velocity, pose) and publishes the poses..

All of these stuffes which I can come up with are high-level thinking, which always refer to the interface of some framework, instead of what is behind them.

Knowing which level I am thinking on, does help to find the right searching boundary of possible solutions.
