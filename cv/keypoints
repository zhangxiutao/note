The extraction of vi-sual content from these low dimensional representations enable to design algorithmsfor interpreting the observed scene.  One way of extracting image information is bycomputing  image  salient  point,  commonly  called  interest  points  or  keypoints,  thatcan be easily recognized across different views of the same scene.
